# noticeboard
Programs for a Raspberry Pi embedded in a corkboard for my to-do list etc

The visible software on this is based on Emacs' org-mode, showing my
"things to do" list.

The noticeboard also has a keyboard on a motorized sliding shelf, a
PIR detector, a couple of LED halogen-replacement bulbs, and a Picam.

The 12V PSU for the screen and the keyboard motor can be switched on
and off by a solid-state relay controlled from the Pi.

The program is intended to be run from Emacs (with the start-process
function) and can take commands on its standard input.
